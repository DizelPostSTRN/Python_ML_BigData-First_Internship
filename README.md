This is a copy of my repository from an internship at the company '......'

Some assignments have been lost.

The internship process was based on the book "The Quick Python Book - 3 edition". Below are links to the book and other sources.


====== ch04_basics =====

The mission itself is lost.


=====ch05_collections =====

Read chapter 5 of the "The Quick Python Book - 3 edition".

Task1 - Write a function that removes the three largest elements from an integer list (list size >= 3) and returns a list of the results. If the largest element is not unique at some step, remove the one closest to the end of the list. The original list should not change.

Task2 - Write a function that takes 4 lists of numbers and outputs the number of unique ones.

Task3 - Write a function that takes two lists of positive numbers and outputs the largest ordinary number, or zero if the total number is not found.


===== ch06_strings =====

Read chapter 6 - Strings of The Quick Python Book
Covered topics:
■ Understanding strings as sequences of characters
■ Using basic string operations
■ Inserting special characters and escape sequences
■ Converting from objects to strings
■ Formatting strings
■ Using the byte type
note: reading formatting sections is optional

The mission itself is lost.


===== ch07_dictionaries =====

Read chapter 7 - Dictionaries of The Quick Python Book
Covered topics:
■ Defining a dictionary
■ Using dictionary operations
■ Determining what can be used as a key
■ Using dictionaries as caches
note: reading 7.5 Sparse matrices and further sections is optional

Task1 - Write a function that creates swapped dictionary (keys and values interchanged) for given dictionary.
In original dictionary multiple keys may refer to the same value, so, new value should be tuple with all corresponding keys.
Example: dictionary {1:2, 3:4, 5:4, 7:2, 9:4} swapped to {2: (1, 7), 4: (3, 9, 5)}
Hint: use 'for' loop like in book's section 7.3
Function signature: def swap_dict(d)
Your solution should contain Python code of the program.
You have to deliver Eclipse project contains your solution to Git repository for review.
Ask your tutor if you have any questions.

Task2 - Write a function that creates compact version of dictionary.
In compact dictionary keys are grouped by original dict's values into tuples.
Example: dictionary {1:2, 3:4, 5:4, 7:2, 9:4} compacted to {(3, 9, 5): 4, (1, 7): 2}
Hint: use 'for' loop like in book's section 7.3
Function signature: def compact_dict(d)
Your solution should contain Python code of the program.
