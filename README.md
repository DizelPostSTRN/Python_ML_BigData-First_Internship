This is a copy of my repository from an internship at the company '......'

Some assignments have been lost.

The internship process was based on the book "The Quick Python Book - 3 edition". Below are links to the book and other sources.


ch04_basics - The mission itself is lost.


ch05_collections - Read chapter 5 of the "The Quick Python Book - 3 edition".
Task1 - Write a function that removes the three largest elements from an integer list (list size >= 3) and returns a list of the results. If the largest element is not unique at some step, remove the one closest to the end of the list. The original list should not change.
